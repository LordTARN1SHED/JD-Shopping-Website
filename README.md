## 4. Reflections and Insights  

During the enterprise training course, I successfully completed the development of JD's homepage and product details page. This project brought me a sense of achievement and offered valuable insights into real-world challenges and expectations.

Through hands-on practice, I gained experiences that go beyond the classroom, bridging the gap between academic knowledge and industry requirements. I delved deeply into front-end technologies, discovering the complexity of front-end development. Solving bugs often required a thorough understanding of implementation principles and the relationships between different components.

The workload in front-end development is substantial, akin to a demanding physical task requiring both time and effort. Initially, I assumed the project could be completed in 2-3 days. However, I barely finished in time for the presentation, highlighting the importance of project management and time planning.

I am grateful to my instructor for their patient guidance. Their humorous teaching style and engaging classroom atmosphere made the learning experience enjoyable. This training not only equipped me with practical project experience but also honed my problem-solving skills, laying a solid foundation for my future career. Completing this project was not only a technical achievement but also a significant test of my personal growth and learning journey.
